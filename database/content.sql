This yearâ€™s market started strong and then got another boost when the Bank of Canada lowered its overnight interest rate in January. People who thought the market had no pent-up demand were proven wrong as sales took off again.</p><p>The trend continued in March, as <strong>sales jumped by 11 per cent in the GTA compared to last year</strong>. New listings were up too but by only 5.5 per cent. Toronto Real Estate Board (TREB) president Paul Etherington believes there would have been even more sales if it werenâ€™t for a lack of good listings.</p><p><i>â€œThe fact that sales growth has continued to outpace listings growth suggests that there is pent-up demand in the marketplace, especially for singles, semis and townhouses,â€</i> says Jason Mercer, TREBâ€™s director of market analysis. â€œThis is why we have experienced a sustained period of strong price growth for low-rise types.â€</p><p>TREB data shows that a greater share of high-end detached homes sold in March than sold at the same time last year, resulting in a bump in average prices. In the City of Toronto, the average detached home now sells for more than $1 million. In the 905 regions, detached houses sell for an average price of just over $700,000. For all housing types, the average selling price for the month of March was $613,933, an increase of 10 per cent compared to a year ago.</p><p>While low mortgage rates continue to drive the market, other factors keep Torontoâ€™s real estate market hopping. Immigration to the city is steady, including people returning from out west after the drop in oil prices eliminated job prospects there.</p><p>Manufacturing and exporting industries are benefiting from lower energy costs and the depreciated Canadian dollar which is already leading to more job creation. The Ford plant in Oakville, for example, has added 1,400 positions in the last six months.</p><p>Naysayers suggest that high household debt is a major concern in this country, which could lead to problems in the housing market. Recently Sal Guatieri, senior economist for BMO Capital Markets, said that while there are reasons for concern â€œthe debt isnâ€™t as onerous as some believe.â€</p><p>Guatieri continues, <i>â€œTougher mortgage rules, combined with warnings from the Bank of Canada, Ottawa and the IMF, have kept borrowing on a tighter leash. Barring a further decline in interest rates, credit is unlikely to accelerateâ€¦â€</i> Guatieri believes most Canadians donâ€™t have a debt problem <i>â€œand will have little trouble managing their finances when interest rates finally normalize.â€</i></p><h3>Looking for more information?</h3><a class=\"btn-round\" href=\"buying_a_home.php\">Buying a home</a>\n\n                    <a class=\"btn-round\" href=\"selling_a_home.php\">Selling a home</a>\n                ','2015-05-15 20:25:17'),(7,'AboutHeadline','<h1>About Mustafa Zia</h1>','2015-05-15 20:28:08'),(8,'AboutBody','<p><q>To excel in any field you need drive, motivation and the dedication it requires to see your vision materialize.

We had put a lot of work into our current home and was very skeptical that any agent will be willing or able to get us what were asking. On our first meeting with Mustafa Zia we were impressed, his professional expertise in the real estate market was prevalent as he shared with us his approach on putting our house on the market. He came to the table well prepared and put our interests in mind first to ensure we received the best service possible. He said that he would treat our home as if he was selling his own and he definitely delivered on his word. We got exactly what were expected for our house, with that said it was the highest sold house within our area. We can confidently say that if it wasn\'t for Mustafa there is no way we would be able to have achieved the price we got. He has alot to offer as agent and his staff is also exceptional, he works hard and efficiently and the truth is in the results. We would highly recommend him to anyone looking to sell or buy a home, as I have no hesitation in using him in the future.</q></p><p>Michelle &amp; Ryan (Mississauga)</p></div><div class=\"read-more\"><p><q>Hi Mustafa,<br />\n                        Thank you for the beautiful card and calendar.
