                <div class="read-more"> 
                    <p><q>My husband and I needed to put our Mississauga home on the market quickly, as we had already purchased a new home and the closing date was fast approaching. We had put a lot of work into our current home and was very skeptical that any agent will be willing or able to get us what were asking. On our first meeting with Mustafa Zia we were impressed, his professional expertise in the real estate market was prevalent as he shared with us his approach on putting our house on the market. He came to the table well prepared and put our interests in mind first to ensure we received the best service possible. He said that he would treat our home as if he was selling his own and he definitely delivered on his word. We got exactly what were expected for our house, with that said it was the highest sold house within our area. We can confidently say that if it wasn't for Mustafa there is no way we would be able to have achieved the price we got. He has alot to offer as agent and his staff is also exceptional, he works hard and efficiently and the truth is in the results. We would highly recommend him to anyone looking to sell or buy a home, as I have no hesitation in using him in the future.</q></p>
